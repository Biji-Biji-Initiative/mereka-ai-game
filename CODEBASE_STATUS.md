# Mereka AI Game - Codebase Status Report

## Overview
The Mereka AI Game is a Next.js application designed to create an interactive experience where users progress through various phases to understand their human advantages in the age of AI. The game uses a state management system built with Zustand and includes multiple phases from welcome to results.

## Current State

### Core Components
1. **State Management**
   - Using Zustand for global state management
   - Persistent storage with `zustand/persist`
   - Complex state structure handling user info, game phases, challenges, and responses

2. **Game Phases**
   ```typescript
   enum GamePhase {
     WELCOME
     CONTEXT
     TRAITS
     ATTITUDES
     FOCUS
     ROUND1
     ROUND2
     ROUND3
     RESULTS
   }
   ```

3. **Key Features**
   - User profile management
   - Trait assessment system
   - AI attitude tracking
   - Focus area selection
   - Challenge-response system
   - Profile generation

## Critical Issues

### 1. State Persistence Issues
- **Root Cause**: Hydration configuration in useGameStore
- **Impact**: State resets during navigation, particularly affecting the FOCUS → ROUND1 transition
- **Current Status**: Breaking game flow
- **Files Affected**: 
  - `src/store/useGameStore.ts`
  - `src/components/game/GamePhaseNavigator.tsx`
  - `src/components/game/Round1.tsx`

### 2. Type System Issues
- Implicit 'any' type in onRehydrateStorage
- Missing comma in store configuration
- Location: `src/store/useGameStore.ts` (lines 423-425)

### 3. Navigation Flow Problems
- Inconsistent state transitions between phases
- Race conditions between state updates and navigation
- Particularly problematic in FOCUS → ROUND1 transition

### 4. Component Hydration
- SSR/CSR mismatch in components
- Affects: `app-header.tsx` and other components using conditional rendering

## Technical Debt

1. **State Management**
   - Complex nested state structure
   - Redundant state updates
   - Missing type safety in some areas

2. **Error Handling**
   - Incomplete error boundaries
   - Inconsistent error state management
   - Missing fallback UI for error states

3. **Type Definitions**
   - Some implicit any types
   - Incomplete interface definitions
   - Missing documentation for complex types

## Immediate Action Items

1. Fix State Persistence
   ```typescript
   // Remove from useGameStore.ts
   skipHydration: true,
   ```

2. Address Type System Issues
   ```typescript
   onRehydrateStorage: (state: GameState) => {
     console.log('Hydration finished.');
   },
   ```

3. Improve Navigation Logic
   - Implement proper state checks before phase transitions
   - Add loading states during transitions
   - Implement proper error handling for failed transitions

4. Component Hydration
   - Implement proper mounting checks
   - Add loading states
   - Handle SSR/CSR differences properly

## Long-term Recommendations

1. **State Management Refactor**
   - Split store into smaller, focused stores
   - Implement proper state validation
   - Add middleware for logging and debugging

2. **Type System Improvements**
   - Complete type coverage
   - Add proper documentation
   - Implement stricter type checking

3. **Testing**
   - Add unit tests for state management
   - Implement E2E tests for game flow
   - Add integration tests for API interactions

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implement proper code splitting
   - Optimize state updates
   - Add proper caching mechanisms

# Mereka AI Game - Technical Debt and Improvement Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the technical debt identified in the Mereka AI Game codebase and provides a comprehensive plan for addressing these issues. The focus is on refactoring and integrating existing components without creating unnecessary new features, as approximately 95% of the required functionality is already present in the codebase.

## Technical Debt Categories

### 1. State Management Issues

- **Zustand Store Configuration**
  - `skipHydration: true` in `useGameStore.ts` prevents state restoration from localStorage
  - Missing comma after the `partialize` function definition
  - Implicit `any` type for the `state` parameter in the `onRehydrateStorage` function
  - Complex, deeply nested state structure in `useGameStore`

- **State Access Patterns**
  - Inconsistent state access patterns across components
  - Mismatched property paths (e.g., `state.personality?.traits` vs `state.traits`)
  - Potential race conditions in state updates during phase transitions

### 2. Navigation and Game Flow

- **Button Navigation Issues**
  - "View Results" button on Round3 page doesn't navigate properly
  - Inconsistent navigation patterns between direct URL navigation and button clicks

- **Phase Transition Logic**
  - Lack of proper evaluation between rounds before progression
  - Insufficient synchronization between URL and game phase state
  - Missing error recovery to prevent users from getting stuck

- **UI Inconsistencies**
  - Some pages show incorrect headings despite being on the correct URL
  - Inconsistent styling between assessment components

### 3. Error Handling

- **Error Boundaries**
  - Incomplete implementation of error boundaries across all components
  - Lack of fallback UI for error states in some components

- **Error Reporting**
  - Insufficient error messages and logging
  - Inconsistent error handling patterns across the codebase

- **Null Checking**
  - Missing null/undefined checks in critical operations
  - "Cannot read properties of undefined" errors in various components

### 4. Integration Points

- **Badge Service**
  - Errors in the GameIntegration badge service
  - Incorrect state formatting for badge service

- **Challenge Generation**
  - Issues with challenge generation logic
  - Incorrect API call handling

- **Authentication**
  - Incomplete Google sign-in integration
  - Empty `game-progress.ts` file in auth directory

- **Results Sharing**
  - Incomplete implementation of results sharing functionality

### 5. Testing and Documentation

- **Unit Tests**
  - Insufficient test coverage for critical components
  - Missing tests for state management logic

- **Documentation**
  - Outdated or incomplete documentation
  - Missing API documentation for mock services

## Improvement Plan

### Phase 1: Core Game Flow Stabilization (Completed)

- ✅ Fix navigation system with proper error handling and phase completion checks
- ✅ Implement consistent round evaluation system across all rounds
- ✅ Fix import path issues
- ✅ Verify preselected options across all assessment components

### Phase 2: State Management Refactoring

- **Priority: High**
- **Timeline: 1-2 days**

1. Fix Zustand store configuration:
   - Remove `skipHydration: true` from `useGameStore.ts`
   - Add missing comma after the `partialize` function
   - Provide explicit type for the `state` parameter in `onRehydrateStorage`

2. Standardize state access patterns:
   - Ensure consistent property paths across components
   - Add proper null checks for all state access
   - Implement loading states for asynchronous operations

3. Improve state update logic:
   - Add proper error handling for state updates
   - Implement atomic updates to prevent race conditions
   - Add validation for state transitions

### Phase 3: Error Handling Enhancement

- **Priority: Medium**
- **Timeline: 1 day**

1. Implement comprehensive error boundaries:
   - Add error boundaries to all page components
   - Create consistent fallback UI for error states
   - Implement graceful degradation for all critical operations

2. Enhance error reporting:
   - Add detailed error messages and logging
   - Implement consistent error handling patterns
   - Create a centralized error reporting mechanism

### Phase 4: Feature Integration

- **Priority: Medium**
- **Timeline: 2-3 days**

1. Complete badge service integration:
   - Fix state formatting for badge service
   - Implement proper error handling for badge service
   - Ensure badges are correctly awarded based on user performance

2. Finalize Google sign-in:
   - Complete the implementation of Google sign-in
   - Integrate authentication with game progress
   - Implement proper error handling for authentication

3. Implement results sharing:
   - Complete the implementation of results sharing functionality
   - Add social media sharing options
   - Ensure proper formatting of shared results

4. Integrate leaderboard functionality:
   - Ensure leaderboard data is correctly displayed
   - Implement filtering options (global, similar-profile, focus-specific)
   - Add time-based filtering (daily, weekly, monthly, all-time)

### Phase 5: Testing and Documentation

- **Priority: Low**
- **Timeline: 1-2 days**

1. Implement comprehensive testing:
   - Add unit tests for critical components
   - Implement integration tests for game flow
   - Add end-to-end tests for the complete user journey

2. Update documentation:
   - Create comprehensive API documentation
   - Update technical debt documentation
   - Create user documentation for the game

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Minimal Changes Approach**:
   - Focus on fixing existing code rather than creating new components
   - Leverage the existing 95% of functionality
   - Only create new components when absolutely necessary

2. **Incremental Refactoring**:
   - Address issues in small, manageable chunks
   - Test thoroughly after each change
   - Commit changes regularly with descriptive messages

3. **Prioritization**:
   - Focus on critical issues that affect core functionality first
   - Address user-facing issues before internal refactoring
   - Tackle technical debt that impacts maintainability

## Commit Strategy

All significant changes will be committed to the repository using the provided GitHub token. Each commit will include:

1. A descriptive commit message explaining the changes
2. Reference to the specific issue or technical debt being addressed
3. Documentation updates reflecting the changes made

## Conclusion

By following this improvement plan, we will stabilize the Mereka AI Game codebase, making it more maintainable and functional. The focus will be on refactoring and integrating existing components without creating unnecessary new features, as approximately 95% of the required functionality is already present in the codebase.

# Technical Debt and Implementation Issues

This document outlines the technical debt and implementation issues identified in the Mereka AI Game codebase, along with recommendations for addressing them. It serves as a guide for future development and refactoring efforts.

## Navigation System Issues

### 1. Inconsistent State Access Patterns

**Problem:** Components access state using different property paths than what actually exists in the store.

**Examples:**
- Round1 component tries to access `state.roundResults.round1` when the actual structure is `state.responses.round1`
- Components reference `state.traits` instead of `state.personality.traits`
- Components reference `state.selectedFocus` instead of `state.focus`

**Solution:**
- Standardize state access patterns across all components
- Create typed selectors for common state access patterns
- Add proper TypeScript interfaces for all state structures

### 2. Mismatched Function Signatures

**Problem:** Components call store functions with parameters that don't match the function signatures.

**Examples:**
- Round1 component calls `saveRound1Response('round1', { challenge: challengeContent })` with two parameters, but the store implementation expects only one string parameter

**Solution:**
- Ensure function signatures are consistent between definition and usage
- Add proper TypeScript typing for all function parameters
- Consider using a more robust state management pattern like Redux Toolkit or Zustand with proper action creators

### 3. Direct Store Manipulation

**Problem:** Components try to directly manipulate the store state instead of using defined actions.

**Examples:**
- Components using `set` directly or trying to update nested state properties directly
- Using `setTimeout` to update store state, creating temporal coupling

**Solution:**
- Always use defined store actions for state updates
- Create more granular actions for specific state updates
- Implement proper middleware for side effects instead of using setTimeout

### 4. Improper Phase Transition Logic

**Problem:** Navigation between phases isn't consistently implemented.

**Examples:**
- Some components handle navigation directly with `router.push()`
- Others rely on the store to update the phase
- Inconsistent checks for phase completion

**Solution:**
- Centralize navigation logic in the GamePhaseNavigator
- Make GamePhaseWrapper the single source of truth for phase transitions
- Implement a consistent pattern for phase completion checks

## Component Architecture Issues

### 1. Lack of Error Boundaries

**Problem:** No proper error handling for when data is missing or API calls fail.

**Examples:**
- Uncaught exceptions when trying to access properties of undefined objects
- No fallback UI when components fail to render

**Solution:**
- Implement error boundaries around all major components
- Add proper error handling for API calls
- Provide fallback UI for error states

### 2. Inconsistent Completion Checking

**Problem:** The code uses different methods to check if a phase is completed.

**Examples:**
- Sometimes checking an array of completed steps: `completedSteps.includes('focus')`
- Other times using a function: `completedPhase(GamePhase.FOCUS)`

**Solution:**
- Standardize on a single method for checking phase completion
- Use the `getIsPhaseCompleted` function consistently across all components

### 3. Temporal Coupling

**Problem:** Using `setTimeout` to update the store after setting local state creates temporal coupling and race conditions.

**Examples:**
- `setTimeout(() => { saveRound1Response('round1', { challenge: challengeContent }); }, 0);`

**Solution:**
- Remove all setTimeout calls for state updates
- Use proper async/await patterns for sequential operations
- Consider using a state management library with middleware support for side effects

### 4. Poor Type Safety

**Problem:** Many parts of the code don't properly leverage TypeScript's type system.

**Examples:**
- Using `as` casts instead of proper type definitions
- Missing type annotations for function parameters and return values

**Solution:**
- Add proper TypeScript interfaces for all data structures
- Use generics for reusable components and functions
- Avoid type assertions (`as`) in favor of proper type guards

### 5. Violation of Single Responsibility Principle

**Problem:** Components are handling too many concerns.

**Examples:**
- Components handling data fetching, state management, navigation, and UI rendering
- Large useEffect hooks with multiple responsibilities

**Solution:**
- Split components into smaller, focused components
- Extract data fetching logic into custom hooks
- Separate UI rendering from business logic

## Next.js 15 Specific Issues

### 1. Improper Use of Client Components

**Problem:** Overuse of client components when server components would be more efficient.

**Solution:**
- Convert appropriate components to server components
- Use the "use client" directive only when necessary
- Leverage React Server Components for data fetching

### 2. Inefficient Data Fetching

**Problem:** Components fetch data on the client side that could be fetched during server rendering.

**Solution:**
- Use Next.js data fetching methods like `getServerSideProps` or the new App Router data fetching
- Implement proper caching strategies
- Consider using React Query or SWR for client-side data fetching

### 3. Missing Error and Loading States

**Problem:** Many components don't properly handle loading and error states.

**Solution:**
- Implement consistent loading indicators
- Add error boundaries and error states
- Use React Suspense for loading states where appropriate

## Recommendations for Improvement

### Short-term Fixes

1. **Fix State Access Patterns**: Update all components to use the correct state access patterns
2. **Implement Error Boundaries**: Add error boundaries to all page components
3. **Standardize Navigation Logic**: Ensure all navigation goes through the GamePhaseNavigator
4. **Fix Function Signatures**: Update all function calls to match their definitions

### Medium-term Improvements

1. **Refactor State Management**: Consider migrating to a more robust state management solution
2. **Improve Type Safety**: Add comprehensive TypeScript interfaces and reduce type assertions
3. **Extract Business Logic**: Move business logic out of components into custom hooks
4. **Add Comprehensive Testing**: Implement unit and integration tests for critical paths

### Long-term Architecture Changes

1. **Adopt Server Components**: Leverage Next.js 15's server component architecture
2. **Implement Domain-Driven Design**: Organize code by domain rather than technical concerns
3. **Add Feature Flags**: Implement feature flags for safer deployments
4. **Improve Error Monitoring**: Add proper error tracking and monitoring

## Conclusion

Addressing these technical debt issues will improve the maintainability, reliability, and performance of the Mereka AI Game application. By following Next.js 15 best practices and proper software engineering principles, the codebase will be more robust and easier to extend in the future.

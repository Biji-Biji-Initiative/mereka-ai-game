## Routing Fixes

The application's routing system has been completely overhauled to ensure proper navigation between game stages:

- Fixed page routing to implement the correct game flow sequence
- Added state management integration with routing to prevent unauthorized access to game stages
- Implemented proper navigation protection to ensure users follow the intended game path
- Added transition effects between routes for a smoother user experience
- Ensured all routes properly maintain game state during navigation

Each page component now includes proper integration with the game store to track progress and prevent users from skipping stages.

## UI/UX Enhancements

The user interface has been completely redesigned with a modern, futuristic aesthetic that reflects the AI-themed gameplay:

### Design System
- Implemented a cohesive futuristic design language throughout the application
- Created a custom color scheme with glowing effects and gradients
- Added glassmorphism elements for depth and visual appeal
- Incorporated subtle animations and transitions for a dynamic feel

### Component Enhancements
- **Buttons**: Added multiple variants (futuristic, glowing, glass) with hover and active states
- **Cards**: Created glass and glowing variants with border effects
- **Progress Bars**: Added animated gradient fills and glow effects
- **Tabs**: Redesigned with futuristic styling and improved interaction feedback
- **Inputs**: Enhanced with modern styling and validation states
- **Labels**: Updated to match the overall design system

### Page-Specific Improvements
- **Welcome**: Added floating title animation and glass panels
- **Assessment**: Implemented animated progress tracking and modern question interface
- **Focus Selection**: Added hover effects and visual feedback for selection
- **Round Challenges**: Created time indicators with warning states and animated elements
- **Results**: Designed visual data presentation with glowing highlights for achievements

## Game Flow Implementation

The game flow has been completely implemented with proper state management and transitions:

### State Management
- Enhanced the Zustand store with comprehensive game state tracking
- Added state persistence to prevent data loss during page refreshes
- Implemented proper step completion tracking
- Created state-based navigation protection

### Game Components
- **Welcome**: Added proper game initialization and transition to assessment
- **Assessment**: Implemented question navigation, answer tracking, and trait calculation
- **Focus Selection**: Added selection handling with visual feedback and state updates
- **Round Challenges**: Implemented timer functionality, step progression, and score calculation
- **Results**: Created comprehensive results display with profile determination based on performance

### Transitions
- Added smooth transitions between game stages
- Implemented loading states during data processing
- Created transition effects for component mounting/unmounting

## Dependency Optimization

The project dependencies have been optimized for better performance and maintainability:

- Removed outdated `critters` dependency that was causing compatibility issues
- Updated package.json to remove unnecessary dependencies
- Ensured compatibility with Next.js 15.2.4
- Fixed script execution issues in the development environment

## Enhanced Logging System

A comprehensive logging system has been implemented for better debugging and monitoring:

### Logger Core
- Implemented performance measurement tracking
- Added user interaction logging
- Created game event tracking
- Added log buffering for history retention
- Implemented metadata support for contextual information
- Added minimum log level filtering

### Type System
- Created comprehensive type definitions for all logging scenarios
- Implemented structured interfaces for performance, user interactions, and game events
- Added session information tracking
- Created error details formatting

### Log Provider
- Implemented global error handling for uncaught exceptions
- Added session tracking across page loads
- Created log filtering capabilities
- Implemented export functionality (JSON and CSV formats)
- Added automatic cleanup to prevent memory issues

### Visual Log Debugger
- Created real-time log visualization
- Implemented filtering by log level and search terms
- Added export capabilities
- Created collapsible UI for development use

## Known Issues

- **Next.js Module Dependencies**: There are compatibility issues between Node.js v22.13.0 and Next.js v15.2.4 that prevent the application from running in the current environment. This would need to be resolved in a production environment with compatible Node.js and Next.js versions.

- **Development Environment**: The application requires specific environment setup to run properly. See the RUNNING_ENHANCED_APP.md document for detailed instructions on setting up and running the application.
